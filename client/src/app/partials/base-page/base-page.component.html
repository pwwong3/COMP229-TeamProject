            An online survey or 'Web Intercept Survey' is a method for getting
            both qualitative and quantitative feedback from users directly about
            a website. There may be both open-ended and closed-ended questions.
            Such as our survey website, it allows you to add a general view on
            someone or something, update an existing post, respond to otherâ€™s
            post, delete existing post, share some reports, and even print out
            the summary of the responses.
